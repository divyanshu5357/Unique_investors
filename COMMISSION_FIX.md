# Booked Plot Payment Commission Fix

## Problem Description
When a booked plot payment exceeded 75% of the total amount:
1. ‚úÖ The plot status was correctly updated from "booked" to "sold" (by database trigger)
2. ‚ùå The commission was NOT being transferred to the broker account
3. ‚ùå The status was shown as "sold" but commission_status remained "pending"

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `triggerCommissionDistribution()` function in `src/lib/actions.ts`. This function was:
1. Using incorrect RPC function calls (`upsert_seller_commission`, `upsert_upline_commission`) that don't exist or have wrong parameters
2. Not properly using the existing `processCommissionCalculation()` function that handles all commission distribution logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `triggerCommissionDistribution()` function (Line ~2880)
**Before:**
- Tried to use non-existent RPC functions
- Had complex logic duplicating commission calculation
- Would fail silently without proper error handling

**After:**
- Now uses the existing `processCommissionCalculation()` function
- Properly handles errors with detailed logging
- Marks commission as 'paid' only after successful distribution
- Includes comprehensive console logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced `addPaymentToPlot()` function (Line ~2816)
**Before:**
- Immediately checked plot status after payment insert
- Might miss the trigger completion due to timing

**After:**
- Adds 500ms delay to allow database trigger to complete
- Includes detailed logging of plot status checks
- Properly revalidates all affected pages (brokers, associates, etc.)
- Better error handling and status tracking

## How Commission Distribution Works Now

### Flow:
1. **Payment Added** ‚Üí `addPaymentToPlot()` is called
2. **Database Trigger** ‚Üí `update_plot_payment_status()` calculates:
   - Total paid amount
   - Paid percentage
   - Remaining amount
   - If >= 75%, changes status to "sold"
3. **Status Check** ‚Üí After 500ms delay, checks if plot became "sold"
4. **Commission Distribution** ‚Üí If sold and commission pending:
   - Calls `processCommissionCalculation()`
   - Distributes commission using MLM structure:
     - 6% to direct seller (broker)
     - 2% to level 1 upline
     - 0.5% to level 2 upline
   - Updates broker wallets
   - Creates transaction records
   - Marks commission_status as "paid"

## Commission Structure (MLM)
- **Direct Seller (Broker)**: 6% of total_plot_amount
- **Level 1 Upline**: 2% of total_plot_amount
- **Level 2 Upline**: 0.5% of total_plot_amount
- **Level 3+**: 0% (no commission)

## Database Trigger Details
**Trigger:** `trigger_update_payment_status` on `payment_history` table
**Function:** `update_plot_payment_status()`
**Actions:**
- Calculates total paid from all payment_history records
- Updates `paid_percentage` and `remaining_amount`
- Changes status to 'sold' when paid_percentage >= 75%

## Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: New Payment Exceeding 75%
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Booked Plots
2. Select a plot with < 75% paid
3. Add a payment that brings total to >= 75%
4. **Expected Result:**
   - Plot status changes to "sold"
   - Commission is distributed to broker's wallet
   - Transaction records are created
   - commission_status becomes "paid"

### Test Scenario 2: Check Broker Wallet
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Brokers/Associates
2. Find the broker who sold the plot
3. **Expected Result:**
   - Direct Sale Balance increased by 6% of total_plot_amount
   - Total Balance reflects the commission

### Test Scenario 3: Check Upline Commissions
1. If broker has an upline, check their wallet
2. **Expected Result:**
   - Downline Sale Balance increased by 2% (level 1) or 0.5% (level 2)

## Debugging
If issues persist, check the server console logs for:
- `üí∞ Triggering commission distribution for plot`
- `‚úÖ Commission distributed successfully`
- `‚ùå Error in triggerCommissionDistribution`

Look for detailed logging showing:
- Plot details (project, plot number, sold amount, broker ID)
- Commission calculation results
- Wallet update status

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/actions.ts`:
   - Function `triggerCommissionDistribution()` (line ~2880)
   - Function `addPaymentToPlot()` (line ~2816)

## Database Schema
**Relevant Tables:**
- `plots`: Contains booking/payment tracking fields
- `payment_history`: Tracks all payments for booked plots
- `wallets`: Stores broker commission balances
- `transactions`: Records all commission transactions
- `commissions`: Tracks commission distribution details

**Key Columns in plots:**
- `total_plot_amount`: Total price of plot
- `booking_amount`: Initial payment
- `remaining_amount`: Amount left to pay
- `paid_percentage`: Calculated percentage paid
- `commission_status`: 'pending' or 'paid'
- `status`: 'available', 'booked', 'sold', 'reserved'

## Additional Notes
- Commission is only distributed once per plot
- The `commission_status` field prevents duplicate distributions
- All commission calculations use the `processCommissionCalculation()` function
- The system supports multi-level marketing (MLM) structure with uplines
- Wallet updates are atomic to prevent race conditions
