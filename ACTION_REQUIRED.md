## üö® ACTION REQUIRED (5 Minutes):

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

1. **Open**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select**: Your project
3. **Click**: "SQL Editor" (left sidebar)
4. **Copy**: The SQL below
5. **Paste** & **Click "Run"**

```sql
-- Fix plot status trigger to only mark as 'sold' at 100% payment

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_plot_payment_status()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    total_paid DECIMAL(12, 2);
    plot_total DECIMAL(12, 2);
    new_percentage DECIMAL(5, 2);
    new_remaining DECIMAL(12, 2);
BEGIN
    SELECT total_plot_amount INTO plot_total FROM plots WHERE id = NEW.plot_id;
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount_received), 0) INTO total_paid FROM payment_history WHERE plot_id = NEW.plot_id;

    IF plot_total > 0 THEN
        new_percentage := (total_paid / plot_total) * 100;
        new_remaining := plot_total - total_paid;
    ELSE
        new_percentage := 0;
        new_remaining := 0;
    END IF;

    UPDATE plots SET remaining_amount = new_remaining, paid_percentage = new_percentage, updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = NEW.plot_id;

    -- CHANGED: Only change to 'sold' at 100% (was 75%)
    IF new_percentage >= 100 AND (SELECT status FROM plots WHERE id = NEW.plot_id) = 'booked' THEN
        UPDATE plots SET status = 'sold', updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = NEW.plot_id;
    END IF;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 2: Verify Changes

1. **Go to**: Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Brokers/Associates
2. **Check**: Vikas kashyap
   - Plots Sold: Should show **1** (not 0)
   - Total Balance: **‚Çπ3,04,000**

3. **Go to**: Booked Plots
4. **Check**: Plot #20
   - Status: **booked** ‚úÖ
   - Can add payment: **Yes** ‚úÖ

---

## What This Migration Does:

**Before**:
- 75% paid ‚Üí Status changes to "sold" ‚ùå
- Can't add more payments ‚ùå

**After**:
- 75% paid ‚Üí **Commission distributed**, status stays "booked" ‚úÖ
- 100% paid ‚Üí Status changes to "sold" ‚úÖ
- Can collect full payment ‚úÖ

---

## That's It!

After applying the migration:
- ‚úÖ Everything is fixed
- ‚úÖ System will work correctly for all future plots
- ‚úÖ Plot #20 can receive remaining ‚Çπ6,00,000
- ‚úÖ All commissions distributed correctly
