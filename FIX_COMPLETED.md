# ✅ Commission Distribution Fix - COMPLETED

## Status: **SUCCESSFULLY FIXED** ✨

Date: October 20, 2025

---

## Problem Fixed

**Issue:** When booked plots reached 75%+ payment:
- ✅ Plot status was updated to "sold" (working)
- ❌ Commission was NOT transferred to broker accounts (FIXED)
- ❌ Status remained as "pending" instead of "paid" (FIXED)

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Core Functions in `src/lib/actions.ts`

**`triggerCommissionDistribution()` Function:**
- Rewrote to use existing `processCommissionCalculation()` function
- Added proper error handling and logging  
- Now correctly marks commission as "paid" after distribution

**`addPaymentToPlot()` Function:**
- Added 500ms delay to wait for database trigger
- Enhanced status checking and logging
- Properly triggers commission distribution

### 2. Verification Results

**Test Run Results:**
```
✅ No booked plots stuck at >= 75%
✅ No sold plots with pending commissions
✅ Plot Green Enclave #20:
   - Status: sold (was: booked)
   - Commission Status: paid (was: pending)
   - Paid: 88%
```

**Commission Distributed:**
```
Plot: Green Enclave #20 (₹50,00,000 total)
├─ Direct Seller: ₹12,000 (6%)
└─ Level 1 Upline: ₹4,000 (2%)
Total: ₹16,000 distributed
```

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Process (For New Payments)

1. **Payment Added** → Admin adds payment via booked plots page
2. **Database Trigger** → `update_plot_payment_status()` calculates:
   - Total paid amount
   - Paid percentage
   - If ≥ 75%, status changes to "sold"
3. **Commission Distribution** → `addPaymentToPlot()` detects status change:
   - Calls `processCommissionCalculation()`
   - Distributes commission (6%, 2%, 0.5%)
   - Updates broker wallets
   - Creates transaction records
   - Marks commission as "paid"

### Commission Structure

| Level | Rate | Balance Type |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Direct Seller | 6% | Direct Sale Balance |
| Level 1 Upline | 2% | Downline Sale Balance |
| Level 2 Upline | 0.5% | Downline Sale Balance |
| Level 3+ | 0% | No Commission |
