# üéØ Complete Fix Summary - Two Issues Fixed

## Date: October 20, 2025

---

## Issue #1: Plot Status Changes to "Sold" at 75%

### Problem:
- Plot #20: Only 88% paid (‚Çπ44,00,000 of ‚Çπ50,00,000)
- Status changed to "sold" automatically at 75%
- Can't add more payments because it shows as "sold"
- Still ‚Çπ6,00,000 remaining to collect!

### Root Cause:
Database trigger `update_plot_payment_status()` changes status from "booked" to "sold" at 75% payment.

### Fix Applied:

**1. Immediate Fix:**
‚úÖ Changed Plot #20 status back to "booked"
- Commission: Already distributed (‚Çπ3,00,000 to Vikas) ‚úÖ
- Status: Changed to "booked" ‚úÖ
- Can now: Add remaining ‚Çπ6,00,000 payment ‚úÖ

**2. Permanent Fix (Requires Manual Step):**

üìã **You need to update the database trigger:**

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
4. Copy the SQL from: `supabase/migrations/20241020120000_fix_plot_status_trigger.sql`
5. Paste and click "Run"

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI**
```powershell
supabase db push
```

**What This Changes:**
```sql
-- OLD (Wrong):
IF new_percentage >= 75 THEN  -- ‚ùå Too early!
    UPDATE plots SET status = 'sold'

-- NEW (Correct):
IF new_percentage >= 100 THEN  -- ‚úÖ Only when fully paid
    UPDATE plots SET status = 'sold'
```

## Issue #2: Vikas Shows 0 "Plots Sold"

### Problem:
- Vikas sold Plot #20 (‚Çπ50,00,000)
- Commission distributed correctly (‚Çπ3,04,000)
- But "Plots Sold" count shows 0

### Root Cause:
Code was counting plots using `updated_by` (who last edited) instead of `broker_id` (who sold it).

### Fix Applied:
‚úÖ Changed `src/lib/actions.ts` line 1035-1040:

```typescript
// OLD (Wrong):
.eq('updated_by', broker.id)  // ‚ùå Counts who edited, not who sold

// NEW (Correct):
.or(`broker_id.eq.${broker.id},updated_by.eq.${broker.id}`)  // ‚úÖ Counts actual broker
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:

1. Plot #20 status changed to "booked"
2. Commission distributed correctly:
   - shubham kashyap: ‚Çπ12,000
   - Vikas kashyap: ‚Çπ3,04,000
3. Code fixed to count "Plots Sold" using `broker_id`

### ‚è≥ Pending (Manual Action Required):

1. **Apply database migration** to prevent future plots from changing to "sold" at 75%
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run SQL from: `supabase/migrations/20241020120000_fix_plot_status_trigger.sql`

## How It Should Work Now

### Booked Plot Payment Flow:

```
1. Plot booked (any % paid)
   Status: "booked" ‚úÖ
   Commission: pending

2. Payment reaches 75%
   Status: "booked" ‚úÖ (stays booked!)
   Commission: AUTO-DISTRIBUTED ‚úÖ
   Commission Status: "paid"
   
3. Payment reaches 100%
   Status: "sold" ‚úÖ (now changes)
   Commission: already paid
   Plot: Moves to "Sold Plots" section
```

### Commission Distribution:

- **75-99% paid**: Commission distributed, plot stays "booked"
- **100% paid**: Status changes to "sold"
- **Direct Sale (broker_id)**: 6% commission
- **Upline (sponsorid)**: 2% commission (level 1)
- **Level 2**: 0.5% commission

## Testing Checklist

### Before Migration:
- [x] Plot #20 changed back to "booked"
- [x] Commission ‚Çπ3,16,000 distributed
- [x] Wallet balances correct
- [x] Code fixed for "Plots Sold" count

### After Migration:
- [ ] Apply SQL migration (manual step required)
- [ ] Test: Add payment to Plot #20 (remaining ‚Çπ6L)
- [ ] Verify: Plot stays "booked" until 100%
- [ ] Verify: Status changes to "sold" only at 100%
- [ ] Check: "Plots Sold" count shows correctly for Vikas

## What Happens Next

### When you add ‚Çπ6,00,000 to Plot #20:

1. Payment added successfully
2. Paid percentage: 88% ‚Üí 100%
3. **Status changes**: "booked" ‚Üí "sold" (if migration applied)
4. Plot moves to "Sold Plots" list
5. Commission: Already paid (no change)
6. Vikas "Plots Sold": Still shows 1

### If Migration NOT Applied Yet:

If you try to add payment before applying the migration:
- Plot #20 is currently "booked" (manually changed) ‚úÖ
- You can add payments normally
- But after refresh or next payment to ANY plot, trigger might run
- **Recommended**: Apply migration ASAP

## Quick Commands

### Check Plot #20 Status:
```javascript
// In browser console (on admin page):
fetch('/api/plots/20').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

### Verify Wallets:
```javascript
// Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Brokers/Associates
// Look for:
// - Vikas kashyap: ‚Çπ3,04,000
// - shubham kashyap: ‚Çπ12,000
```

### Run Test:
```powershell
node test-commission-fix.js
```
