# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Summary - Commission Distribution

## What Was Wrong?
Code was sending commission to **wrong person** (last editor instead of broker)

## What Was Fixed?
Changed code to use **`broker_id`** (correct) instead of **`updated_by`** (wrong)

## Current Status: âœ… FIXED

### Wallet Balances (Verified):
```
shubham kashyap: â‚¹12,000 âœ…
Vikas kashyap:   â‚¹3,04,000 âœ…
Total:           â‚¹3,16,000 âœ…
```

## Files Changed:
1. `src/lib/actions.ts` - Fixed 2 functions
2. `fix-commissions-direct.js` - Recalculation script (already run)

## What To Test:
1. Check admin dashboard wallet balances
2. Add new payment â‰¥75% to any plot
3. Verify commission goes to correct broker

## If Problems Return:
Run: `node test-commission-fix.js`

This will show if there are any stuck plots or pending commissions.
