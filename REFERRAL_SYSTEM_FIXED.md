## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Error: "Could not find the 'note' column"
**Problem**: Code was trying to insert a `note` field that doesn't exist in the `broker_referrals` table.

**Fix**: Removed the `note` field from the insert statement.

### 2. ‚ùå Error: Wrong field names in approval process
**Problem**: 
- Using `upline_id` instead of `sponsorid` for profiles table
- Using `processed_by` and `new_broker_id` fields that don't exist

**Fix**: 
- Changed to use `sponsorid` (correct field for MLM structure)
- Removed non-existent fields from update statements

## How the Referral System Works

### Step 1: Broker Submits Referral

**Broker does:**
1. Goes to `/broker/referral` page
2. Fills in the form:
   - Full Name of new broker
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number
3. Clicks "Submit Referral"

**System does:**
- Creates a record in `broker_referrals` table
- Status: `pending`
- Links to referrer (current broker)

### Step 2: Admin Reviews Referral

**Admin does:**
1. Goes to `/admin/referrals` page
2. Sees all pending referrals
3. For each referral, decides to:
   - ‚úÖ **Approve**: Creates account
   - ‚ùå **Reject**: Declines with reason

### Step 3: Admin Approves Referral

**When admin approves:**

**Admin provides:**
- Username (for login)
- Password (for new broker)

**System automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Creates auth account in Supabase
   - Email: from referral
   - Password: set by admin
   - Email confirmed: true

2. ‚úÖ Creates profile in `profiles` table
   - Name, email, phone from referral
   - Role: `broker`
   - `sponsorid`: Set to referrer's ID (MLM structure)

3. ‚úÖ Creates wallet in `wallets` table
   - Initial balances: ‚Çπ0
   - Ready for commissions

4. ‚úÖ Updates referral record
   - Status: `approved`
   - Processed date: current timestamp
   - Stores username & password

### Step 4: New Broker Can Login

**New broker receives:**
- Email: (from referral form)
- Password: (set by admin)

**New broker can:**
- Login at `/login`
- Access broker dashboard
- Start selling plots
- Refer other brokers

## Database Schema

### `broker_referrals` Table

```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- referrer_id (UUID) ‚Üí profiles.id
- referrer_name (TEXT)
- referrer_email (TEXT)
- referred_name (TEXT)
- referred_email (TEXT)
- referred_phone (TEXT)
- status (TEXT): 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
- rejection_reason (TEXT, optional)
- username (TEXT, set on approval)
- password (TEXT, set on approval)
- role (TEXT, default: 'broker')
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- processed_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

### MLM Structure

When referral is approved:
```
Referrer (Broker A)
    ‚Üì (sponsorid)
New Broker (Broker B)
```

This creates the commission hierarchy:
- Broker B sells plot ‚Üí Gets 6% commission
- Broker A (sponsor) ‚Üí Gets 2% commission (level 1)
- Broker A's sponsor ‚Üí Gets 0.5% commission (level 2)
